Git is designed to be used through a Command Line Interface, CLI, that is, typing commands into a terminal or command prompt. However, it can also be used with Graphical User Interfaces, GUIs.  
GitHub is a web-based platform that is used to host software developments and version control using Git. It is an effective collaboration platform for Developers to:  
- manage different versions of their codes
